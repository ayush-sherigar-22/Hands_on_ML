    "## 1️⃣ Chapter 2 Retrospective\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. What could I do before Chapter 2 that I should NOT do now?\n",
    "\n",
    "- I used to preprocess the entire dataset before splitting without considering future data.\n",
    "- I assumed this was harmless, but it caused data leakage from test data into training.\n",
    "- I focused more on making data “clean” than on preserving a realistic evaluation setup.\n",
    "- I trusted evaluation results without questioning whether the process itself was flawed.\n",
    "- Now, I treat the test set as unseen future data and protect it from any influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. What can I do now that I could NOT do before Chapter 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can identify when data leakage might occur and clearly explain why it happens.\n",
    "- I can make informed decisions about preprocessing choices instead of treating them as arbitrary steps.\n",
    "- I can justify model errors with concrete reasons rather than assuming the model is simply bad.\n",
    "- I can diagnose whether poor performance comes from data issues, features, or model behavior.\n",
    "- I now think in terms of causes and consequences instead of blindly applying techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Which concept in Chapter 2 was hardest to truly understand? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding how features influence model learning was the hardest concept.\n",
    "- Initially, I treated features independently and assumed the model learned them in isolation.\n",
    "- I did not understand how one dominant feature could overshadow others during training.\n",
    "- Feature relationships and correlations confused me because I couldn’t visualize how the model “sees” them.\n",
    "- Error metrics were hard to interpret without connecting them back to feature behavior.\n",
    "- Over time, I realized diagnosis only makes sense when errors are linked to features.\n",

    "## 2️⃣ Skill Inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Skills I now understand well\n",
    "- Loading, cleaning, and preparing raw data in a structured way.\n",
    "- Exploring data to understand distributions, patterns, and obvious issues.\n",
    "- Visualizing data to support decisions instead of just plotting for visuals.\n",
    "- Core preprocessing concepts such as imputation, scaling, and encoding.\n",
    "- Building end-to-end pipelines using column-wise transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Skills I partially understand\n",
    "- Recognizing when errors are significant versus when they are acceptable.\n",
    "- Diagnosing whether issues come from data, features, or model behavior.\n",
    "- Interpreting learning curves and performance graphs confidently.\n",
    "- Understanding feature importance beyond surface-level rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Skills I do not understand yet (and why that’s okay)\n",
    "- How different models work internally at a mathematical level.\n",
    "- Distinguishing true causality from correlation in real-world data.\n",
    "- Step-by-step computations happening during model training.\n",
    "- Knowing which hyperparameters matter most before deeper model study.\n",

    "## 3️⃣ Mental Model Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "- Earlier, I thought a good model was one that achieved very high accuracy.\n",
    "- Now, I believe a good model is one whose behavior I can understand, even if accuracy is lower.\n",
    "- I no longer trust performance numbers unless training and validation behave consistently.\n",
    "- A model feels good to me only if I can explain how it learned and why it makes certain errors.\n",
    "- I care less about pushing metrics and more about improving features and their relationships.\n",
    "- Earlier, failure meant low accuracy; now failure helps me understand model limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ End-to-End ML Workflow (Plain Language)\n",
    "\n",
    "- I started with raw data by understanding what I am trying to predict and what information is available.\n",
    "- Before building any model, I explored the data to notice patterns and factors influencing predictions.\n",
    "- I separated the data early so evaluation would be done on truly unseen data.\n",
    "- I prepared the data carefully so the model learned only from training information.\n",
    "- I trained an initial model to establish a baseline and observe its behavior.\n",
    "- I studied errors to understand whether the model was too simple or too complex.\n",
    "- Any improvements were guided by what the errors revealed, not by blindly improving metrics.\n",
    "- I finalized the model only when its behavior made sense and results felt trustworthy.\n",

    "## 5️⃣ Readiness Check for Week \n",
    "\n",
    "**Can I explain why my model fails?**  \n",
    "YES  \n",
    "→ Error diagnosis helps me identify whether failures come from data, features, or model limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can I justify model choice beyond metrics?**  \n",
    "YES  \n",
    "→ I can justify a model by explaining how it learns patterns and treats features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can I explain a prediction to a non-technical person?**  \n",
    "YES  \n",
    "→ I can explain predictions at a high level by describing key factors influencing the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do I understand why tuning doesn’t always improve performance?**  \n",
    "NO  \n",
    "→ I know tuning exists, but I don’t yet fully understand when or why improvements saturate.\n",

    "## 6️⃣ One-Line Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "- I am now unlikely to preprocess data before splitting, because I understand how easily it leads to data leakage and misleading results.\n",
